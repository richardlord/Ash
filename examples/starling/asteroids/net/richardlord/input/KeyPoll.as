	 * <p>Games often need to get the current state of various keys in order to respond to user input. 
	 * This is not the same as responding to key down and key up events, but is rather a case of discovering 
	 * if a particular key is currently pressed.</p>
	 * 
	 * <p>In Actionscript 2 this was a simple matter of calling Key.isDown() with the appropriate key code. 
	 * But in Actionscript 3 Key.isDown no longer exists and the only intrinsic way to react to the keyboard 
	 * is via the keyUp and keyDown events.</p>
	 * 
	 * <p>The KeyPoll class rectifies this. It has isDown and isUp methods, each taking a key code as a 
	 * parameter and returning a Boolean.</p>
